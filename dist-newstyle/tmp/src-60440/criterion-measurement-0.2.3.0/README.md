# criterion-measurement

[![Build Status](https://github.com/haskell/criterion/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell/criterion/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

Measurement-related functionality extracted from Criterion, with minimal dependencies. The rationale for this is to enable alternative analysis front-ends.
